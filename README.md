### So, I want to Create Some Content!

I want to write and get my thoughts out. Kind of driven to do so anyway. Writers just do that -- they write. So I want to have a place for that. I want to create space for sharing my thoughts, plans, projects and creations. I'll be making more videos soon too (hopefully you can't find all the older ones!) As for who I am in real life? I'm a lot more like a giraffe than you might think. I don't make any money, and I don't attempt to. That would be harlotry. And yes, working for fiat debt-based currency is **literal prostitution.** You trade your valuable time and energy for scraps of paper or digits on a screen. I don't. I'm just an old used up whore, who worked hard physical labor jobs for decades, and ended up ~~*'disabled'*~~ enabled to do nothing else but use my mind and inner ingenuity to write voluminous tomes and impossibly huge sentences, casting aspersions on all who would deign to play the game *'the way it is supposed to be played'*, *'the way everybody else does'*, etc... not because I think I'm *better* than anyone else, but because I have a stubborn form of integrity (probably related to my hatred of authority), and ***I Refuse to Sacrifice My AUTHENTICITY for ANYTHING.*** I absolutely hate the **FAKENESS** so prevalent in society today.

### I reject your *Contrived Reality* and substitute my own!

### Just so I make this more than clear, I consider **Google**, **Fakebook** and **Twatter** to be a huge part of the *'fakeness'* problem, so you will not find me supporting those platforms.

I'm not against making an honest living. We all have to do what we can to support ourselves and our families. But I will personally forego all advertising, unless it is something I really believe in; and even then, I would ***NEVER*** allow an advertiser to have a say in what kinds of content I choose to create. But they ***do*** sorta have a say ***anyway!*** If one is attached to that ad revenue stream they may mince their words, or curb their authenticity in favor of retaining that income, even if that possible income loss is only a thought in their mind, **ad revenue always colors content.**

That reminds me of something George Orwell said:
> "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements, and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news."  ~ George Orwell

Of course, he also said...
> "News is something somebody doesn't want printed; all else is advertising."  ~ George Orwell

### So, what am ***I*** advertising?
### FREEDOM.
### Honesty, Integrity & Authenticity.

### So, I guess I'll have to rely on donations then!
Grrr... Why do I feel like a panhandler all of a sudden?

I am interested in a lot of things, like security, privacy, freedom of speech, anonymity... you know, all those things that get one called a *'rayciss ebil nahtzee!'* nowadays; so yeah, I won't be putting out more than a *'giraffic persona'* to the world any time soon. But what you should be asking yourself is,

### "Do *I* reflect more than a mere *'persona'* to the universe?"
If not, why not?

I do tend to watch some videos on YouTube on occasion. In fact, you may often find me recommending *you* watch some! (I listed some below!) I do **not** support Google in any other way, and if I can find the videos elsewhere I'll watch them there. Yes, I hate Google that much. I'll be writing an article and making a video on how to easily unGoogle very soon, so keep an eye out! So that would be **NO.** I do **not** have a YouTube Channel. I don't monetarily support anybody but my family because I have no money, but I **do** approve of some of the content I see being created there, and I *definitely* spread links to the good stuff around to the people I know. I'll be posting a list of recommended channels soon here too...

As for now, I'll just mention that I *do* watch [***'Distro Tube'***](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg/featured) and [***'Chris Titus Tech.***](https://www.youtube.com/user/homergfunk) I'm a lot like them, (minus the shaved head, or normie Windoze IT experience.) I *used to* watch [***'Switched to Linux'***](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoryWpk4QVYKFCJul9KBdyw) just for fun sometimes, but he's not been fun at all as of late. (I blame religion, but he's mostly just been too whiny lately -- kinda reminds me too much of myself at times! And don't get ***me*** started on ***my*** ISP! Alright, maybe it's a phase (I go through them all the time), but...

**I always want to remember to have fun and to be fun!**

I've had different experiences and take a different approach, but that's also why my viewpoint is valuable too. I'm no competition, because I'm not making any money -- so how could I be threatening anyone else's income stream?

### I'm irreverent, non-professional, awkward, and long-tongued, but fun.

Why do I suddenly feel like I'm filling in an online-dating form?

### How do I differ from *'other*' content creators?
- I don't *think* like a normal *'content creator'*; as in, I do not think that I ***'own'*** my own engenderings.

- I do not own the *viewpoint* of others -- *when, where* or *how* they experience my creativity.

- My main focus and goal is not to make money, or even support myself or my family. It never has been.
> Yet I've managed to raise two children completely on my own, home school almost all the way through, and took my kids around the world on an income that is one-third of the poverty level!

> inb4 illegal activities. Nope! Focus on what is important. Have kids? Spend time with 'em.

- Focusing on self-expression to the exclusion of all else has allowed ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`*** to get caught up in *different* illusions than some *'other'* viewpoints have -- and, **ain't that always the way of *'Self'*?!**

- I am not caught up in, nor do I support the advertising model the way it is on the internet today.
> Nobody likes ads, but content creators are as much to blame as anyone for becoming attached to revenue streams where such blatant lack of integrity is involved.

- I don't want to get caught up in creating or guarding revenue streams.

- I don't want to whine or blame others; but I **do** want to point out pernicious behavior when I recognize it; even in myself.

- I don't want to talk about things I barely have any experience with, nor do I want to talk about what everyone else is talking about. I want to talk about what matters.
> ##### Well, to me, anyway!

And just what is that? Let's find out together now, shall we?
