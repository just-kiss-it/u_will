Finished up the video [JKI Belch-Dances With Kate](https://www.bitchute.com/video/XuTbrtu4CmzG/) this morning.

Need to put the [`Just-Kiss-It` Bitchute Channel](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/just-kiss-it/) on the [https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/](https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/)  front page as a clickable icon.

Grrr... What a pain! Not easy! It feels like HydeJack Theme intentionally complicates things.


At least I should be able to fix my icon.ico today.

Guess I'll push my example category being changed in three places to blog category, and some changes to `config.yml` and `social.yaml` up to Github and see if my changes to credential authentication and signing work yet! Somehow I doubt it...

But it did!

Checked out [`LBRY`'s *`lbryio/lbry-desktop`* Github page](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/).

Here's a good link re: [LBRY Data Backups](https://lbry.com/faq/backup-data).

Installing [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) now...

I did post a video at [https://lbry.tv/JKI-Burp-Dances:4](https://lbry.tv/JKI-Burp-Dances:4) (on da interwebz) -- (or open [lbry://JKI-Burp-Dances#4](lbry://JKI-Burp-Dances#4) in the app); but I didn't post it under my channel name, ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`***, like an idiot! And I paid 4 LBC to post it anonymously at that location too! But coolio. I have bigger problems. I still haven't gotten the app to work on my laptop running Debian 10 Buster. Didn't even want to do LBRY today, but I guess I needed another outlet. Whatever. **I better focus on having something worth saying first!** Well, I have plenty to say, but getting my thoughts out in cohesive form so they can be understood by others has sometimes proven difficult!

It looks like one can edit the URL on a LBRY upload, but one has to upload the file again; and pay more LBC, of course! So, pretty much, if I want to requisition my own video from myself at ***that*** link location and move it to *my* ***own*** link location under ***my*** channel name, I have to bid at least 4 LBC on it, or settle for some funky, long-ass URL! I'll wait until I have more LBC. Gotta get into the groove of it, I guess -- ***OR NOT!***

Installing `gconf-defaults-service` in case that helps the LBRY app work, as that is a Suggestion for `gconf2`.

It didn't. Still Troubleshooting... [https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/issues/386](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/issues/386)

### WOW ! This Port Checking Tool Is Great !

Gonna try just turning off the machine and restarting first, before messing with port forwarding, etc... but checking the logs will also be of great value... [https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-find-lbry-log-file](https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-find-lbry-log-file)...
