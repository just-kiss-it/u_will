### RESPONSIBILITY

### GIRAFFISMS:

> The amount of responsibility huge corporations like **Amazon** and **Google** have for creating reality for all of us is **huge.** We need to hold them accountable.
##### But how are they using these vast powers?
By protecting themselves from being held accountable! By ever-tightening controls over what people think, do or say; and further enslaving all of mankind to their *own* ideals.
##### THIS is what it is like living in a CORPORATOCRACY.
> What is good for the few is ***rarely*** good for the many!

> **inb4** *'Communism'*. lol no, spank you!

#### As for *MY* Voice?
Everybody knows that giraffes are generally soft-spoken, if they even speak at all, but **I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GIRAFFE!** I'm not reserved, and I talk a ***LOT!*** But I ***don't*** have any *'social media'* stuff going on at all. As far as interacting with *'others'* on da interwebz, I have kind of a *'chan'* background and approach, so my skills and practice at playing nice are sorely lacking. I'll be working on that, but ***I WILL NOT ACCEPT OR TOLERATE OVERT EXTERNAL CONTROL -- EVER.*** Not much of a conformist either, you might find...
>*(and the Understatement of the Year Award goes to `'Just-Kiss-It'`!)*

I'll be writing a bunch of articles, (in fact, I've been working on some for awhile), and when they are ready I will *let loose with 'em!*

What does *that* have to do with [RESONANCE](resonance.md)?
> the giraffe is changing the subject again...

No, seriously; the article on [RESONANCE](resonance.md) will be *epic!*
> you say that like it's a *good* thing!

Yeah, kinda in an *'editing'* phase in *all* areas of my life right now... ***It's Brutal!***

Last night I played around with [`'Hugo'`](https://gohugo.io) a bit on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org). Pretty much spent more time getting that virtual machine upgraded properly. Freakin' [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org)-based rolling-release distros, anyway!

#### I also started a [*'TODO'* List](TODO.md) last night.

It may fill out even more soon; but, as you can see, ***THERE IS MUCH TO DO!***

Got thrown off my game ***AGAIN*** this morning by `LBRY`; while trying to help my friend get into it.

#### ***THIS*** Is Why, If You're a Programmer...
### DO NOT *EVER* PUT ANYTHING INSIDE THE EMAIL BOX THAT YOU WANT THE USER TO ENTER INFO INTO. It's Irritating.

On their Android app it is even worse. It says something like `'hotstuff_xxx@example.com'` in the box -- which I guess goes with their whole ***'Porn'*** atmoshpere, but that turns most people off immediately.

I ***REALLY*** Don't Like Them Right Now. I even fired off an email to them with the Above Image Attached...

#### They Sure Replied Fast! I mean, within 2 minutes!

#### Here is my Reply to their reply...

### I then went and did some other things worth taking `'Notes'` over...

> **inb4** *'he doesn't know how to keep his colors!'*

> **inb4**  *'he unironically uses KDE...'*

Yup. This last year had me finally beginning to become a **KDE** believer! Yeah, I still run back to **XFCE** several times a day just to get my head straight, but I kinda like the workflow on different Desktop environments *(not to speak of the very **BEST** Desktop Environment -- **NOT HAVING ONE!**)*

#### As for building a website:

Yes, *anyone* can have a website if they so desire, with *very little* knowledge, and the more I play with [`'Hugo'`](https://gohugo.io), the more I think it might work better for many people than [`'Jekyll'`](https://jekyllrb.com). I had previous experience *(but not good!)* with [`'Ruby'`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and I thought I would have to learn the [`'Go'`](https://golang.org) language, so I went with [`'Jekyll'`](https://jekyllrb.com) at first, and I'm still using it. There is a lot that can be learned by trying several static site generators and comparing differences and similarities in folder structure and treatment of variables though. Most people, however, don't need to tear everything apart to see how it works -- and they won't need to design their own themes, so they should ***TAKE HEART! It's Much Easier Than I Make Everything Look!*** Just Go [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io)! Install a [Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io), and start slappin' content in there!

He covered the subject probably better than I've seen it covered before. As for how slow [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv/) is? Sorry! You can go look for his videos on YouTube if you want, but I'm trying to steer folks *away* from continuing to support *'evil'*.
