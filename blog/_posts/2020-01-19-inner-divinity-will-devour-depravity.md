### Inner Divinity Will Devour Depravity.

> #### *'SHE'* must be set loose to lap up every drop of blood from the severed head of Raktabeeja.
~ ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`***'s waking thought today...

The ***'asuras'*** of this corporate oligarchy we live in are certainly on my mind this morning!
#### Yet *all* egoic forces can *only* be defeated from *WITHIN*.

In case you need a brief reminder of how the *Goddess* has always defeated the demonic hordes arrayed against *'Her'*, [...here's a quick link...](http://dalsabzi.tripod.com/Articles/kali_maa.htm) that gives a semi-decent accounting of the story. Much can be gained by the avid student in further study of this story as it relates to Shaktism and Kashmir Shaivism. (which reminds me of another link I used to share a lot... [https://realitysandwich.com/170364/secrets_kashmir_shaivism/](https://realitysandwich.com/170364/secrets_kashmir_shaivism/) ... ***DEFINITELY 'WORTH IT'***)

Had a deeply introspective and somewhat fun day today. Spent much time philosophizing and bantering about fun things with friends and family. So often, in this modern world full of attention-whoring gadgetry, we forget the simple pleasures of a playful walk in the snow.

But I can't say I did not favor interacting with technology over interacting with humans at some point today! No, like everything else I do, **I went full bore!** On the 15th, I mentioned the folks over at [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), and their associated website, [https://huggingface.co/transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers), where you can guide *AI* through a kind of *'creative-writing'* exercise, producing written word that could be indistinguishable from that produced entirely by humans. *(that reminds me, I could link to the entry from the 15th, but I'm planning on making 'permalinks' tomorrow, and I don't want to break them before I even create them!)* **And *that* reminds me of how much fun we had today conversing about the nature of creativity and inspiration!**

> #### As a child, having the Bible shoved in my face as the *'inspired word of God'*, I learned the argument well -- If it is the *'words'* that are inspired, then you've already tainted it by translating from the original Hebrew and Aramaic *(and taking the language out of the context of the times)*; but if it is the *'prophet'* who is inspired to write the words, then *any* ole' person can get inspired to write *anything*, and *any* ole' folks could be convinced that those were the very words of *'God'*!

#### Stranger things happen every day...
##### Stranger things are said...

#### So, what would *'Artificial Intelligence'* say, if it could talk to us?

Kinda working on an idea, behind the scenes right now...

But in the meantime, I'd like to share an article that was written word-for-word by ***'Artificial Intelligence'*** *(with my guidance.)* The AI made the phrase, word and punctuation *suggestions*, and I made the choices of what made it in the article. I found the exercise *so* beneficial and illuminating that I wish you would ***ALL*** play with it a bit!

Again, the website is...

Feel free to *'fork'* it. Sharing is caring. ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`*** is a big believer in *'open source'* projects.

So, yeah, I did a few *other* things today too...

Thought I'd share...
