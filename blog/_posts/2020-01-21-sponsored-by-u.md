### This Has Been Sponsored by the Letter `'U'`:
### Frustrated?
#### Fretting over *'problems'*?
### GET BACK TO WORK.

Of course, I didn't do much writing today! Mostly did doctors, paperwork, research, and I may have played around a bit more with the [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator in Manjaro! I really wish there was a way to get an up-to-date install of [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io/) from a Debian repository. Alas, Arch-based seems to be my best bet. Probably better bets for others. Just like actual website deployment. I'm choosing [**Gitlab**](https://about.gitlab.com/), and will probably use the `rsync` method of deployment, as described in this link: [https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-rsync/](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-rsync/); but there are a whole host of other options one can *'go'* with. *(see what I did there?)* Seriously though, no need to learn the `GO` programming language; and I'm beginning to feel like this may be easier for *'newbs'* than [`'Jekyll'`](https://jekyllrb.com/). Just check out some of these [`'HUGO'` Hosting & Deployment Options](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/).

I guess I could be nice and list the links most helpful to start out with [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io/):

- [https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

- Grab a Theme: [https://themes.gohugo.io/](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

- Learn about Modules: [https://gohugo.io/categories/hugo-modules](https://gohugo.io/categories/hugo-modules)

- Just check out the whole site, obviously!

- Don't miss the [Migrations](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/) Page.

#### Wonder if [`'LBRY'`](https://lbry.com/) will ever be a viable site?
