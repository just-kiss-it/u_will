### REGROUPING...

Started this day out right!

[AUDREY AND KATE × Yoyoka ”Bulls on Parade” Rage Against the Machine Cover / Session With Yoyoka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R7lmx8c9_Q). ~ ***'WORTH IT'.*** [4:34]

Played a bit on [8kun.top/freedomzine/](https://8kun.top/freedomzine/) this morn.

Created the ['Artificial Intelligence' Thread](https://8kun.top/freedomzine/res/1339.html). Looks like someone has commented already. ***'Johnny Neptune'*** seems unlikely to grace **8kun** with much of his presence. You should have seen his replies to the following texts!

Well, they're still at it...

Checked out some interesting projects on [Github](https://github.com/) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) today...

### I've Heard of 'Github'. What is 'Gitlab'?
#### Well... If you want the ***awesome*** 1 1/2 minute version...
#### ["What is GitLab? Explained To Children"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb0ZRY2_-4Q)...

I also played with [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io/) some more, but found myself getting distracted by other random thought processes...

![2020-01-24-141700.png](https://i.imgur.com/59o0v3M.png)

Actually toyed with the idea of of `'brew'` installing [`'HUGO'`](https://gohugo.io/) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). They ***do*** have a ***LOT*** of [packages available via the Homebrew package manager for Linux](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula-linux/), and I would be able to get a pretty up-to-date version going on Debian (installed in the Home Directory); but after some research, and reading this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9zqhhh/linuxbrew_homebrew_on_linux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9zqhhh/linuxbrew_homebrew_on_linux/), I was like, ***'HELL NO!'***

![2020-01-24-152727.png](https://i.imgur.com/MC5XIpI.png)

#### Time to Learn [`'Docker'`](https://www.docker.com/)*!*

##### And yes... [`'HUGO'` on 'Dockerhub'](https://hub.docker.com/r/jojomi/hugo)*!*

##### Maybe I would like the [*'Play with Docker Classroom'*](https://training.play-with-docker.com/) Tutorials?

(*as an aside; no, I did not install* `'apt-list'`, *although it did look like an interdasting dependency of* `'homebrew'`).

#### As Far as Using `'HUGO'` on Github or Gitlab **'Pages'** goes... READ THIS:

#### [https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)

When you understand that page and implement what is described, you will have arrived!

***REALLY*** Need to brush up on what I know about **`'Git'`**.

[David Mahler's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEoaojfEY_6L5TWWjIn9t9Q) has some **really** well done videos, with lots of nice diagrams and visualizations; besides invaluable introductions and reviews. ***ENJOY!***

While we're on the subject of YouTube Videos, and I still have **AI** on my mind, I'll mention this YouTube Series...
> {% include green.html %} \> inb4 **'YouTube Originals'**

[How Far is Too Far? ~ The Age of A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8) [34:39]

There's more in the series, but that one isn't half-bad; which reminds me, I've gotta add more **AI** Links to the ["This Article Was Written ENTIRELY by AI"](2020-01-19-this-article-was-written-entirely-by-ai.md) article.

I also need to consolidate the last few days worth of Notes into one Blog entry. **Don't make a production out of it!** Just pick the important stuff and **git on it!**

### TODO:

- [x] Put an {% include green.html %} \> inb4

`.html `'include' or 'partial', or whatever it's called in the `'u_will'` repository.

*(yeah, I just did a* `'green.html'` *file instead, but I did not end the* \</span> *)*

````
<span style="color:#01DF01">
````

Now, for doing an

> {% include green.html %} \> inb4

use:

```
> [% include green.html %] \> inb4
```
but replace the **[** and **]** with **{** and **}**.

*(why was that so hard! it's a code-block, for kryssake!)*

(and yes, ya gotta put in the *'escape character'*, **\**, before the **>**, otherwise `'Jekyll'` will think the **>** means something else!)
