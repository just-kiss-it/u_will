### Sociopathically Optimistic

### The *Beginning* & *End* are Always at the Same Juncture -- *Here* & *Now*...

Sometimes I like to fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit-hole... The deeper I fall, the more *'I'* am *'lost'* in the experience...

### The stance one takes in any inception will be the same stance one can be found in at the terminus.

> {% include green.html %} > *he eternally pretends all is not eternal!*

Workin' on the **'About'** Page this morning, after a couple days away from even *touching* a computer! Been making a lot of introspections and determinations. Really an important phase. Like any other phase, the most important part is *'paying attention'* -- **MINDFULNESS.**

One thing I've also gotta mention is *'inspiration'*. The writing of ["*This Article Was Written ENTIRELY by AI*"](2020-01-19-this-article-was-written-entirely-by-ai.md) really got me thinking about the nature of *inspiration*, and about how everything seems *in on* a conspiracy to portray *for* everything *'else'* ***that*** *'beholden' for* which ***that*** *'beholder'* is ***most*** *'in need of' for* ***that*** *'placetime'*.

### And just *who* ***IS*** *that* Beholder?
> #### **Isn't that *always* the question?**

The *'inspiration'* I had the other night to install the `'laptop-detect'` package was ***exactly*** what it took for the **Debian 10 Buster** OS I'm running on this machine to finally recognize the battery well enough to not freeze up whenever it was accidentally unplugged.

![2020-01-24/2020-01-24-141700.png](https://i.imgur.com/59o0v3M.png)

In fact, I'm running it *sans* cords right now! (but about ready to plug in the ethernet cable, since I don't use wi-fi much -- not secure enough), which reminds me:

- [x] Gotta harden up that Wi-Fi today!

- [x] Write **'About'** blurb for sidebar

- [x] Write [**'About'**](about.md) Page *(well, started it, anyway!)*

- [ ] Slap the [**'About'**](about.md) Page in as a **'README.md'** on the [https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will](https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will) Page for now too. *(soon!)*

- [x] Get rid of the [Documentation](404.md) page in favor of an [**'Articles'**](articles.md) Page.

- [ ] Figure out how best to do the Months, the Articles, pretty much the ***'List'***-type Pages (keeping in mind the transition to [`'Hugo'`](https://gohugo.io/).) *(always figuring better ways)*

- [ ] on *that* note, figure out **'Tags'** too! *(that may take awhile, especially taking `'Hugo'` considerations into it!)*

- [x] Backups (`'rsync'` [**'Timeshift'**](https://teejeetech.in/timeshift/) of **'Root'** and `'rsync'` [**'LuckyBackup'**](http://luckybackup.sourceforge.net/) of **'Home'**.)

- [x] Wow! Looking up that link showed me that the tool I have used for years, [**'LuckyBackup'**](http://luckybackup.sourceforge.net/), is no longer under active development; so, **FIND ANOTHER TOOL!** You need a **GUI**? Just use `'grsync'`.

- [x] and that sent me off studying about using [**'Timeshift'**](https://teejeetech.in/timeshift/) with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), as described in this link: [https://forum.manjaro.org/t/timeshift-doesnt-create-scheduled-snapshots/66903](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/timeshift-doesnt-create-scheduled-snapshots/66903)

- [x] Sign up for and get [`'Docker'`](https://www.docker.com/) going.

- [ ] Get [`'Docker'` **Engine** for Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)

- [ ] Play with the [`'Hugo'` Dockerhub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jojomi/hugo).

- [x] Backups of your [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) `.kdbx` database.

- [x] Put up a blog entry for [**'2020-01-29-Sociopathically-Optimistic'**](2020-01-28-sociopathically-optimistic.md) today, and **Include Video LINKS.**

> The Souk al-Manakh was Kuwait’s unofficial over-the-counter stock market, headquartered in an air-conditioned parking garage. But, as you’ll soon learn, miraculously managed to grow to the 3rd largest equity market on earth (only trailing America and Japan) with stock prices that commonly doubled on an hourly basis — only to come crashing done in the most unbelievable way.

> Economic inequality, corruption, low GDP growth, and poor public services have fuelled anti-government protests across the Western Hemisphere. The political climate is more polarised than before, and many states are finding it difficult to balance the needs of their citizens and that of the IMF. Protectionist barriers are being set up, migrants and refugees are spilling over the borders, and for the first time in decades, political instability has reached the United States where public confidence in national institutions is diminishing. These, and more, will carry all sorts of consequences for North and South America in the coming year.

> Beijing has industrialized faster than any nation in history. Now, it is also aging faster than any nation.

> There is no doubt that China is emerging as a regional powerhouse. In the past thirty years, its GDP has grown from just 177 billion USD to 12,2 trillion USD. But there is a flaw in China’s model of growth. Demographic data shows that the country is now facing a severe decline in population. China’s fertility rate is dropping, people are living longer, and the workforce is shrinking. For a country whose young workforce is the backbone of its economy, these demographic trends are harbingers of social, economic and political disaster.

> The key to quitting sugar is understanding the 5 things in your way: Your brain, environment, habits, gut and (maybe) friends.

> Diet and health has always been a big topic as of recently, especially with the number of  overweight and obese people with diabetes increasing. While there is a bit of a fight between low carb and high carb, the thing that deserves the most attention is quitting sugar, as cutting out refined sugars and processed foods is the most sure-fire way to improving health and regulating weight. The mindset and approach of really understanding how and why bad habits like this develop can be applied to all sorts of things (stop smoking etc.)

### Don't Get Lost in the Minutiae!
#### (Let the *Whole 'thing'* sweep you away!)

**There is much to do, and I feel impelled to do it.** Just *what* exactly am I trying to achieve, and *how* do I plan on expending *my* time and energy in the pursuit of *which* goals?

### *Who* ***is*** this ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`*** *persona* that is being pawned off on the world, anyway?

> {% include green.html %} It is already well known that I cannot expect ***any*** support for ***any*** endeavor, even if it were elegant; and most of my endeavors are not. *(although they are **always** 'grand'!)*

### *'Expectations'* are ***so*** gauche.

Both *expectations* ***for*** support, and *expectations* ***of*** support can be avoided by simply *not participating* in the panoply of ***'seeking support'!*** So, the question always arises,
> {% include green.html %} > *'simply'*, huh? ***'How will you support yourself and your family?'***

- [x] Maybe it's time to start a [**SUPPORT**]() Page! *(started...)* **DO MORE for SUPPORT.**

Nobody wants to wind up as a beggar on the street-corner, but ***AUTHENTICITY*** often demands more of us than we expect, and being beholden to others for sustenance ***ALWAYS*** colors the message. **I am a 'messenger'!** I have a message to deliver, and **I will NOT allow *any* message to be tainted by *any* means of *'Support'*.**

### *'Expectations'* are anathema to Honesty, Integrity and Authenticity.

I don't expect those who come into contact with the content I deliver to drop all their expectations; but experience tells me they would have a far better time if they did! Everywhere! And with everyone and every*thing*!

- [x] Maybe make *'dropping expectations'* a *way-of-life*?

Faith often leads to expectations. Certainty has always seemed to me to be a surer guide. But ***what*** can one really be *'certain'* of? Well, ***change***, for one thing! But *certainly*, it does not hurt to be *certain* about ***certain*** things; *'amirite'*? *Experience* often leads to greater certainty; and my experience has made me ***certain*** that *'faith'*, *'beliefs'* and *'ideologies'* are generally dangerous and evil; especially when applied in a social context! They are rarely employed for any other reason than conformity and control; neither of which has any value to true authenticity. And **AUTHENTICITY** is pretty much all I've ***ever*** been about!

![2020-01-29/the-dude-abides.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/H5JSmog.jpg)

### *Authenticity* does not seek conformity anywhere; nor doeth it make determinations of dominion.

### I would not trade the time I have spent with loved ones for anything.

While I often pursue goals that my family and friends have no desire to feign interest in, I love and care for them very much. I've enjoyed the time we've spent together.
