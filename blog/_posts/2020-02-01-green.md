### On Green:

{% include green.html %} Was dorking off on `'Green'` (not *that* kind of green -- the *'green'* **MX-19 usb**!) this morning, just playing, looking at new stuff in `Aptitude` -- ran across this…

#### Looked interdasting, so I followed the White Rabbit…
{% include rabbit.html %}
#### It *is*, after all, February 1st!
> ### *'RABBIT, RABBIT, WHITE RABBIT!'*

> ###### *'inb4'* that rabbit is ***GREY!***

> *inb4* I misspelled *'gray'* !

> ##### I'm getting *greyer* every day too...

Nice enough quote, and a completely *out-of-my-league* blog-site full of completely alien subjects to me, but the **`'Dukto'` Project** seems cool enough to me, and it *did* come up as a *'new'* Debian package in the repository, so I might try it to see if it works for me, despite the warning…

#### Alright, Stop Wasting time…

Wish I had, but decided to see how insane the [*'Qtards'*](https://8kun.top/qpatriotresearch/index.html) had gotten lately...

#### Wew Lads!

### Yeah, many of them are ***'terrorists'-in-waiting...***

Dunno if I'll ever waste much more time on **8Kun**, besides as a repository to take dumps in now and then...

#### But I *DO* Need to *Wrap-Up* the Past!

The amount of introspection going on lately has been palpable.

##### I was *very* embarrassed and ashamed when I read through the recent blogposts and saw that I had turned into [*'Killcen'*](), with neverending lists of links that nobody *(including me)* will ever click on!

**I almost gave up on the spot.** Like I usually do. *(Probably the* **only** *reason I didn't.)*

but...

## I DO ***NOT*** WANT A *'BLOG'*!
#### I've *Never* Wanted One!
Sure, I have a need to *'express'*, but I've been analying *that* too. It may just be that I feel like I am never heard.
> back to the [**'Can U Here Mi Nao?'**]() Article? **FINISH IT.**

I've decided that, instead of dropping everything I'm doing and going off to do something entirely different *(like I almost always do)*, I'm going to stick with this idiotic *'blog'* thing until I figure out *wtf* it is that I'm ***REALLY*** up to! But, for the record...
### I *REALLY* HATE *'BLOGS'*.

I think of this as more of a ***'NOTES'*** thing, and I'm going to treat it as such; since I'm neither seeking, nor attracting, an audience.

> {% include blue.html %} So, it's like *'Fakebook'* and *'Twatter'*, but instead of *whacking off* with *'others'*, you're just playing with *your'self'*?

### Pretty Much.
##### At Least for Now.
#### I'll be exploring *'Persona'* a lot more around here though...

Also busy wrapping up a lot of things from the past; and as I learn and grow, I'll be sharing some of that too...
