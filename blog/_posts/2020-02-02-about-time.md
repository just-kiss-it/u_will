### *ABOUT* Time

### WHO AM I AND WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

{% include giraffe.html %}

Sounds like more of a daunting task of *self-discovery* than a mere *depiction* one could fit in a *'short'* treatise!

> {% include red.html %} But that's what I ***want!***  A short little blurb that says a bit about myself and what it is I'm trying to achieve!

> {% include green.html %} That's *cute*. The giraffe still thinks he can keep anything *short*!

How hard could it *be* to write an [***'ABOUT'***](/u_will/about/) Page?

> {% include green.html %} Says the giraffe who hasn't been able to pull it off in over a year between 3 different websites!

I mean, *ordinary* people talk about themselves and their personas all day long on places like ***Fakebook***, ***Twatter*** and ***Instasham***! Why do ***you*** find it so difficult?

> {% include red.html %} assumes I am *'ordinary'*! I mean, is ***anybody?***

> {% include green.html %} and I'm not even *'people'*!

> {% include red.html %} nor do I swirl in turd-bowls of social media.

But, as far as giraffes go, I **do** talk a lot, so **this should be easy!**

> {% include red.html %} Hell! I can't even decide whether to call this a *'proem', 'prolegomenon'*, or an *'exordium'*!

> {% include green.html %} might I suggest staying away from any thesauri during the elucidation of this characterization?

Probably a good idea...

Not to change the subject, but I often get confused between first, second, and third-person ways of describing points of view...

> {% include green.html %} not as confused as **I** am, trying to *read* this!

#### So, how does one go about defining oneself, and why would one even *want* to?

{% include red.html %} Are you trying to put me in a box? You want me to put *my'self'* in one?

### Oftentimes it is easier to define ourselves by *what we are* ***not.***

> {% include red.html %} *'oh noes!' *This* could devolve quickly!

> {% include green.html %} Whatever do you mean, ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`***?

> {% include red.html %} Well, you *know* how well those long diatribes that aren't ***'for'*** anything, but are ***'against'*** everything go over, right?

> {% include green.html %} so maybe try to remain *simpatico* without being *ingratiating*?

> {% include red.html %} it'd be *nice* if you just put away that thesaurus!

> {% include blue.html %} **OK.**

{% include ok.html %}

#### There he goes again! Don't let him bring *ANOTHER* Voice into this!

Let's see if we can break this giraffe out of his conversation with himself long enough to figure out *who* he ***thinks*** he is, and *what* he *thinks* he's ***doing*** here!

### *Too easy* to get caught up in the world of *'appearances'*; not to mention *'portrayal'*-of-*'persona'...*

#### That's what a *'Blog'* ***IS!***

> {% include red.html %} maybe I don't ***want*** a *'blog'* then!

Yeah, you've mentioned that a *few* times. **What *do* You Want?**

{% include blue.html %} I guess I'm figuring that, while practicing new skills and developing habits and self-discipline. I guess this is just a record of the process whereby ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`*** finds out just *who* ***`'Just-Kiss-It'` is***, and just *what* ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`*** is all [***ABOUT***](/u_will/about/)!

{% include green.html %} Meanwhile, it is also a place for practicing new skills and developing new habits of self-discipline. in the *gnosis*...

### The Truth of who you are is difficult to express to *another*.

> {% include green.html %} he pretends there ***is*** an *'other'*!

#### The secret always protects itself...
But,

### *Eye See U, Shiva!*

-----

#### Well, I obviously have more writing to do on the [*'ABOUT'*](/u_will/about/) *Page* later...

At least I'll be able to go insert this as an [***'ABOUT'***](/u_will/about/) *Page* ***everywhere*** it is appropriate soon -- including the old [8kun.top/freedomzine/](https://8kun.top/freedomzine/catalog.html) site, the [freedomzine.hashbase.io](https://freedomzine.hashbase.io/) site, and the [just-kiss-it.hashbase.io](https://just-kiss-it.hashbase.io/) site!

The info is still applicable, and will help me wrap up those enterprises with a neat bow...

{% include red.html %} **Just Clean That Shite *Up* Already!**

> {% include blue.html %} nice to be able to go back and change the past, eh?

#### Thanateros!

![2020-02-02/IOT-99x.png](https://i.imgur.com/mF4IwxU.png)

> {% include red.html %} Again with the images that don't show up in dark mode?

-----

{% include green.html %} **Seems like one oughtta be able to wrap *that* up in nice packaging and sell it, eh?**

> {% include blue.html %} *What,* exactly?

Well, seems like one oughtta be able to wrap up an [***'ABOUT'***](/u_will/about/) *Page* with *some* kind of quickness!

### Oh, this is *'some kind of quickness'* alright!

{% include green.html %} But I ***sure*** as hell ain't ***sellin'*** nothin'!

-----

### Shit I did:

- Tried to write the [***ABOUT***](/u_will/about/) *Page*, but got sidetracked by

- all those `.html` `'_partials'`
> {% include blue.html %} Whatever do you mean? *(look below...)*

- Messed with **Tutanota 'AppImage'** again.
> {% include blue.html %} Still lost with the sandboxing issue. I'll have to look that up soon. But it ***is*** aggravating! Freakin' Vanilla **Debian 10** *'Buster'* ***irritates*** me at times. I mean, it's a freakin' **AppImage!** *Never*, on ***any*** other distro have I had a problem with an **AppImage**, including this very **AppImage**. It's enough to make one go **'Arch'!** Stability is nice though. I find the **'Bullseye'** Testing Branch of **Debian 10** to be quite stable though too. All too *'Debian'* for my tastes now though. I sometimes feel the need for more freedom to embrace less freedom in certain areas. I mean, ***'FOSS' Yes!*** But difficulties? ***NO!***

- Spent time with family...

{% include blue.html %} THEN I *REALLY* GOT INTROSPECTIVE!

More on that later...

{% include red.html %} But yeah, *'escape'* may be part of how I have heretofore dealt with the dilemma of *'other'* and *'judgement'*... **Don't wanna do that no more!**

{% include green.html %} I want to ***FEEL -- DEEPLY.***

But I do not want those *'feelings'* to color how I react. In fact, I no longer want to ***'react'*** at ***all!***

#### I only want to *ACT Authentically*, with *Integrity* and *Honesty*.

### I Want to Be *WITH* This Process -- *AWARENESS...*

> {% include green.html %} he pretends that *'escape'* is not *part* of the *'process'*! ***I wonder what it would take to remind him!***

-----

{% include red.html %} Maybe if *'we'* busy him creating some `.html` **`'_partials'`** he'll forget what this page was supposed to be [*ABOUT*]()...

{% include ok.html %}

{% include red.html %} Yeah, I've been escaping writing that [*ABOUT*](/u_will/about/) Page for quite some time now! In *Many* Ways!

{% include green.html %} But I'll be back in awhile... I have ***WAY*** too much to do to sit around here talking about how much I have to do, whilst not doing it!

Just in case you were wondering how the `'.html Entities'` on this page render in different browsers on different devices, I checked it out for you!
