Got up early this morning. Was cogitating; and yes, putting off writing. Thoughts all over the place. So, I decided to be semi-lazy and just watch a video. Of course, it ***had*** to be intellectually stimulating and provide personally valuable timely insights! I think it would be fair to say that this video  would be useful and mostly interesting for ***anybody!*** I even turned my girlfriend on to it early in the afternoon, and *she* enjoyed it! *(Of course, I kicked her out shortly thereafter, but she knows how I get sometimes when I need to focus on work!)*

### Morning Video...

#### [Jim Keller: Moore's Law, Microprocessors, Abstractions, and First Principles | AI Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA)

> Jim Keller is a legendary microprocessor engineer, having worked at AMD, Apple, Tesla, and now Intel. He's known for his work on the AMD K7, K8, K12 and Zen microarchitectures, Apple A4, A5 processors, and co-author of the specifications for the x86-64 instruction set and HyperTransport interconnect. This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.
> > Interview by ~ [*Lex Fridman* on his YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA). I'll be keeping my eye on *this* young man, and *you* should too! He has intelligently interviewed some pretty *'interesting'* people!

### I guess I'm still a *'Jaded Optimist'* too!

It's as much of a shit-show as you wanna make it! And how you see it... is how it ***is***, at least from *your* perspective anyway! Protip: ***That*** is an ever-changing place in time, not to mention the stance!

### FAIR WARNING: My thoughts have been all over the map lately, I've been doing a lot of introspection and am pretty much just vomiting my thoughts out here -- *No Filter* -- So, yeah, I'm not gonna watch my fucking language anymore. If that's gonna be a problem with you, perhaps you should limit your contact with *AUTHENTICITY*.

So, today...

### A few words about Authenticity vs. Conformity & Fear of *The 'Different'...*

Being taller and thinner than most of the herd, I have had a lifetime of experience with judgment and expulsion. There is nothing that conformists hate more than a thing that doesn't *fit*. Anything considered *'ouside the pale'* should either stay there, or it will be ***forced*** to conform.

### The bigger the herd, and the more tightly they are compacted into a small space, the more enforcement of behavioral controls will be placed upon individual members.

It starts with neighbors and fences, but before you know it some bitch could be calling the cops because you threatened to drop-kick her Boston Terrier when it drew blood on your ankle and she's still holding the leash, following you, letting it continue to bite, while you dodge hundreds of dogshits all over the sidewalk from the worthless apartment dog-owners that *never* pick up their dogshit, and you have complained to the City, along with many others, but the cops never do anything, and no laws are *ever* enforced against anyone you *wish* they were enforced upon, but dumb bitches use cops as weapons of mass punishment upon anyone who pisses them off, and the same cops have to show up for stupid shit like that, *then* have to show up *again* several blocks away, 15 minutes later, because some kids called the cops saying a tall creature was walking down the street with an assault rifle, but it was actually just a 20-ounce black coffee thermos you filled at the store, and that trip almost cost you your life twice from fearful folks who think it is helpful to send even more fearful folks into a situation where weapons will be drawn and lives ***actually*** threatened, rather than just the ***perception*** of a threat, then the very next day, when you catch the dogs who keep coming in your yard and killing your chickens, the cops will do nothing about it, just like every other time, but you wish they would stop bothering you about stupid shit based on ***others'*** fears, annoyances, worldviews, ideologies, enforcements of conformity you don't personally appreciate; but you've got a few gripes of your *own* that you wish were more adequately addressed from *your* perspective, but we're all seeing reality throught the lens of our own limited perspectives, no matter how lofty a view we think we have, we literally know very little, *(especially if we think we do);* and then there's the hate, the separation, the division, the ***us***-vs-***them***-ness, the blame, the irresponsibility, the fakeness, the exhausting monotony of ***ickiness*** everywhere, like so much vomit disgorged in a never-ending sentence of denouncements and exculpations...

### In the *ISness* We Are All the Same.
> {% include green.html %} Totally *fucked up* in a *Sublime* way -- and "*Sublimity Depends Upon Unintelligibility.*"

{% include red.html %} Nobody is a *'victim'* here, unless they ***wanna*** be!

{% include blue.html %} We are **ALL** *'Guilty'* of Being ***THAT.*** -- **The ISNess.**

{% include green.html %} There **IS** No *'OTHER'*.

The constant **judgement**, *(usually negative)*, that ***Authenticity*** regularly tolerates from *Conformity* often bubbles over into anger, sometimes even becoming apparent to all, ***which scares the fuck out of conformists!***
> {% include red.html %} '**OMG! Unpredictability!** *What ever will we do?*'

#### It must be rough to live your life inside a ***worldview***, where every new experience must be made to fit.

{% include blue.html %} Most do though.

##### Some few, however, like me, find it much more comforting to be willing to change their entire worldview when new experiences demand it.

### Got a few words to say about Surveillance, and feeling like everything one does is being watched (because nowadays, ***it is....***)

## Perceived Surveillance Inhibits Authenticity.
> {% include green.html %} And *That* Should Be All I Have to Say On the Matter!

{% include blue.html %} If only...

But I *did* just drive my girlfriend away for the *umpteenth* time because I can't be having someone hanging out over my fucking shoulder all the time!  Jeezuz motherfucking kriste! It is literally *IMFUCKINGPOSSIBLE*  for me to act authentically if I think there is a datamining entity of ***any*** *kind* paying attention to *'my'* business instead of minding their ***own!*** FUCK ME! I just can't fucking **do** it!
> {% include red.html %} Noyce outburst, Shiva!
> > {% include green.html %} "*Pleeze sir, I want some moar!*"

> {% include blue.html %} But Jeezuz is *always* watching!

{% include red.html %} Fuck off Jeezuz! **No *Peeping Toms* need apply.**

Which gets us back to *'Surveillance Capitalism'*, *'Corporate Oligarchies'* and *'Big Tech'...*

Funny how **every** topic keeps melding into and out of all others!
> Kind of like how *each* and *every 'viewpoint'* keeps melding into and out of the *'pointless whole'*!

{% include green.html %} Speaking of the hole, ***don't forget da ['Pi-Hole'](https://pi-hole.net/)!***

{% include red.html %} Of All the things they could think of to do with **`AI`** to improve the lives of *all* humans, but *(((these))) idiots* can think of nothing but delivering us ads!

### *It's all a facade!*

#### As far as *'Big Tech'* goes, the following video is pretty interesting from a historical and legal perspective...

[Why Big Tech Will Never Be Broken Up:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmRixwCbvtE) [9:49]

> Should companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook be broken up? More importantly, is it even possible to break up Big Tech, considering the immense role these companies play in our private and business life?

##### Meanwhile, workers from my Internet Service Provider are outside, busy installing some new device on my internet connection!

I feel assaulted from all quarters, and ***I shouldn't have to feel that way!*** It really puts a hitch in my giddyup! Ya gotta kinda *trust the process* or it doesn't work properly though! Authenticity **must** be encouraged. But so must personal responsibility! Sometimes you gotta treat adults like children in order for them to finally grow up in some area or another! I *know* that I ***myself*** have required **much** of this kind of ***'coaxing'*** at times. Too bad our public school system and our social structures do not encourage personal responsibility, rather they demand enforced conformity...

##### Alright, I'm just rambling now... So, I'll leave you with this thought...

### Everyone wants to be accepted.

### Few Practice *Acceptance*.

#### *WHO* Are You Talking To?
