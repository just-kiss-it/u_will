### Future Plans

I really need to get my future plans a little more outlined today, because prioritization demands it. One only has so much time in a lifetime, and the tendencies are toward complexity, building stuff up, crystallization and stagnation, which lead to degeneration, decline and eventual collapse. I have so much I want to get done and feel like I have so little time left to do it all in.
>S'pose **that** ain't rare in ones' fifties!

Anyway, I pretty much spent the day lounging on the couch watching Netflix with my girlfriend yesterday. Left my computer on all day without ever doing a damn thing on it. It was still on this morning waiting for me to get back to writing, programming, organizing -- but **no!** Here I go! Looks like I have a more serious problem developing... My health is suffering. Gonna go take care of that right now. Hard to maintain focus when one's head is this socked up.

Messed around a bit on the HydeJack theme and was actually finally getting somewhere (although I was hating it and thinking of switching themes again anyway), but then, suddenly, this...

A bit of a head-scratcher, so I tried a couple things, but same result.

Then I checked the [Hydejack site](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack)! Aha!

[My Github Site at https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/](https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/) doesn't work anymore either. I'm giving up on his theme. It was geared toward those who pay anyway. The free version is crap...

#### Quick Caveat:

> I am fuckerdumb.

Tell me dear sir, what was your first clue?

> Well, actually, when I saw the dog had unplugged my ethernet cable.

You mean it wasn't when you first tumbled out of bed and forgot to use the word `apt` in your `sudo apt update command` and actually took a commented screenshot thinking there was something wrong with the machine?

> Well, clues have continued to gather in quick that today might be one of those days, but sometimes I like to bash my head against things for awhile...

You mean, like `Jekyll`? How many times have you done that?
> Well, I gave it a good try over 8 years ago when I was running **Linux Mint** at the time; but wow, Ruby and gems and wtf... I gave up because I was still too busy trying to learn **HTML** and everything else at the time, and was really into encryption and cryptocurrencies (long story for later there!), plus I was a single dad who was homeschooling two children, so no time or energy! Anyway, I tried it again about 5 years ago, but that was during my brief return to alcohol; and no one should be drunkenly blogging anyway, let alone trying to program their own static site generator while inebriated. This latest, rather well documented attempt (more blog posts from the past may be put up later -- still not sure...) was pretty much a success, and I do have a couple local sites running, and even one on Github Pages at [https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will](https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will) -- but, like I said, I don't like the theme, I'm getting irritated with `Jekyll` and I want to try `Hugo`...

##### The giraffe is talking to himself in the third person again...
And bis he is all over the map too!

##### So, where to focus my energies from here today?

- Help my daughter set up a **ProtonMail** account, `KeepassXC` on her computer and phone, and **ProtonVPN**, so she can continue using free wi-fi with less danger when she is out and about.

- `add`, `push` and `commit` changes to Github just for practice... [https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will](https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will)

- see if it even worked, rename the repository, shove it in the **'test'** branch and...

- start over with **`HUGO`!** (I mean, this is all about learning anyway.)

- well, don't forget the *main* dealio, which is creating space for *'giraffisms'* and outbursts of every kind.

#### Still trying to keep *this* straight...

- My Github: [https://github.com/just-kiss-it](https://github.com/just-kiss-it)

- `gh-pages` Repository: [https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will](https://github.com/just-kiss-it/u_will) (well, for now anyway!)

- `gh-pages` branch: [https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/](https://just-kiss-it.github.io/u_will/) (where the website in the `gh-pages` repository is being currently hosted)

I used to have a **Github Pages** website hosted from my `master` branch, but that was so 3 days ago!
