#### ***`'Just-Kiss-It'`***, and his sometimes obvious unprofessionalism, are in no way associated with the good folks over at [https://mxlinux.org](https://mxlinux.org). I'm just a guy who happens to enjoy running the KDE Plasma Desktop with MX Linux, has some experience doing so, both on Live USBs with Persistence enabled, and installed on various hardware (some of it quite ancient); and **I feel I have something worth offering to the community.** If anyone finds it useful, cool. I'm just a skinny poor old giraffe with bad manners, a penchant for free speech and a seeming inability to conform enough to develop social skills; who likes to tinker and play with Desktop Operating Systems. I'm not a developer, and I probably can't help you.

{% include green.html %} I've provided written documentation with the **`.ISO`** showing what I did, and there is more information at the **Download** Location:

### I started a [thread on the **MX Linux Forum**](https://forum.mxlinux.org/viewtopic.php?f=127&t=56880&sid=14880020bfc46c7c078d73b538c24e21) about it, but don't want to fill up their Forum with questions about my Personal Respin.

I tried to lead any potential questioners to the NSFW site [8kun.top/freedomzine/](https://8kun.top/freedomzine/res/1418.html) for any discussion, because I have moderation powers there, and I have my machines set up so I don't see ads, so I sometimes forget that they advertise sex toys and other NSFW type stuff on there. But I did get a reminder!

### I was just trying to keep the *riffraff* off the Forum!

Anyway, I didn't think about the fact that they might not want a link to a NSFW site on their forum, so I'll go in and edit that as soon as possible. But yeah, if you can handle possibly witnessing a sex toy advertisement at the top or bottom of the page, that thread on **8kun** is a good place for questions and comments:

#### Now, I'm just gonna repeat a little from my [README on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mx-19-1-kde-by-jki/files/) here:

*(you can go [there](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mx-19-1-kde-by-jki/files/) to read the rest!)*

All I did was downloaded the **Feb 15, 2020 MX-19.1_x64 ISO**, updated, upgraded, installed the **KDE Plasma Desktop**, booted into that and carefully purged the XFCE cruft. Anyone could do it, but satisfactory results are difficult to achieve. I've had varying levels of success with marrying MX Linux & Plasma over several years, and this is the best Respin I've tried, and I have tried many.

I've used it live on a USB, installed it on several older machines & VirtualBox.

It runs great!

Recommending at least 4 GB RAM, 8GB is better. It IS KDE Plasma, after all!)
(Use 3D Acceleration & VMSVGA Settings in VirtualBox)

Yeah, it's a Personal Respin with Persistence.

### **Passwords:**

Remaster Your Own General Respin or I'll Post More `.ISO`s if there's a demand. I did make a General Respin also, and made snapshots of both at xz compression too, making them only a little over 2 GB, but my time is limited right now.

#### I also plan on making a short demonstration video about this Respin on my LBRY site real soon...  [https://lbry.tv/@Just-Kiss-It:2](https://lbry.tv/@Just-Kiss-It:2) so keep an eye out!

I hope some folks find this useful. You can all thank Adrian for starting me down this path several years ago.

Suffice it to say, **THIS RESPIN WORKS!**  (and yes, the `live-usb-maker` works fine too, that I mentioned I was worried about from the MX-18 days.) I have actually found nothing that doesn't work in this respin, and I have tested it extensively, and installed it on several machines; really old ones too.
